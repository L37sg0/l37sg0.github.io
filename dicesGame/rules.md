#Rules:
 The player throws a pair of dice, with max of 3 throws.
The sum of the two top faces is what matters so a 1 and 3
is the same as 2 and 2. The sum of two 6 sided dice can be
any number from 2 to 12. If the player throws a 7 or 11
on the first throw, the player wins. If the player throws
a 2, 3, or 12, the player loses. For any other result
(4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10), this result is recorded as what
is called the player's point and a follow-up throw is
required. On follow-up throws, a throw of 7 loses and a
throw of the player's point wins. For anything else, the
game continues with the follow-up throw rules.
