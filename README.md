# This will be my official webpage.

 In 'old designs' folder you'll find 
every design, that this project 
passed through- for now...
 
# New Stuffs:
- A whole new design!
- First the design now is using css-display-grid.
- Added some animation over the buttons.
- Added some javascript and to be more fun- using XMLHttpRequest.
- And finally added some JSON to keep all the articles.

# Next goals:
- Make an GUI- Desktop app for writing articles in JSON.
